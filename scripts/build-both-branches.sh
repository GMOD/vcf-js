# Builds two refs into esm_branch1/ and esm_branch2/, which the comparison
# benchmark imports side by side.
#
# Each ref is built in a throwaway git worktree rather than by checking it out
# here, so the checkout you are sitting in is never switched and your local
# edits are left alone. That also means what gets benchmarked is each ref as
# committed - uncommitted work in this tree is not part of it.
